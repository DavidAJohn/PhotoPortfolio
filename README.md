## Photo Portfolio

Photo Portfolio, is as the name suggests, a personal photo portfolio application. 

It has been built using Microsoft's .NET framework and features a Blazor and Tailwind CSS user interface with a MongoDb database behind it, and includes integration with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/payments/checkout) and the [Prodigi Print API](https://www.prodigi.com/print-api/).

It is a work-in-progress, personal project with the ultimate goal of removing the need for a subscription portfolio site and replacing it with a more personal, custom solution that still allows print sales, etc.
